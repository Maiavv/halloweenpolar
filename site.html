            I know, I know, I know, I know, know<br>
            I know, I know, I know, I know, know<br>
            I, I know it, I know it<br>
            
            [Kanye West]<br>
            The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest<br>
            Today I seriously thought about killing you<br>
            I contemplated, premeditated murder<br>
            And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...<br>
            Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder<br>
            You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love<br>
            The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest<br>
            (Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhmm)<br>
            Just say it out loud to see how it feels<br>
            People say: Don't say this, don't say that<br>
            Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels<br>
            Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table<br>
            Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder<br>
            I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you<br>
            The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest<br>
            (Mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhm, mhmm)<br>
            I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad<br>
            But sometimes I think really bad things<br>
            Really, really, really bad things<br>
            And I love myself way more than I love you<br>
            See, if I was trying to relate it to more people<br>
            I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme<br>
            But that's not the case here<br>
            I love myself way more than I love you<br>
            And I think about killing myself<br>
            So, best believe, I thought about killing you today<br>
            Premeditated murder<br>
            
            I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins<br>
            I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb<br>
            Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none<br>
            Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb<br>
            Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum<br>
            Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em<br>
            I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue<br>
            I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young<br>
            I done had a bad case of too many bad days<br>
            Got too many bad traits<br>
            Used the floor for ashtrays<br>
            I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache<br>
            I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name<br>
            It's a different type of rules that we obey<br>
            Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey<br>
            We was all born to die, nigga DOA<br>
            Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cape<br>
            Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm, mhm<br>
            If I wasn't shining so hard, wouldn't be no shade<br>
            Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay<br>
            
            Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age<br>
            I thought I was past my Deebo ways<br>
            Even when I went broke, I ain't break<br>
            How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go wayyy back<br>
            To when I had the braids and you had the waveee cap<br>
            Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP<br>
            Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't playyy that<br>
            Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got wayyy packed<br>
            They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)<br>
            All you gotta do is speak on Ye<br>
            All you gotta do is speak on Ye<br>
            Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay</div>
